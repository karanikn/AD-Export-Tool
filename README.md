## ✨ Overview

**AD_Export-Tool** is a single-file PowerShell WPF application that provides a clean, modern GUI for exporting Active Directory data. Designed for IT administrators who need quick, reliable AD reports without writing one-off scripts or navigating RSAT consoles.

All exports support both **CSV** and **TXT** output formats. A built-in logging panel tracks every action in real time.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
.\AD_Export-Tool.ps1
```

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows 10 / 11 / Server 2016+ |
| PowerShell | 5.1 or later (PS7 also supported) |
| Modules | RSAT — `ActiveDirectory` module (for Users, Groups, Computers, OUs, FSMO) |
|  | `GroupPolicy` module (for GPO export only) |
| Domain | Machine must be domain-joined |

---

## 🖥️ Interface

The application features a flat, modern single-window layout:

- **Menu bar** — File (folder selection, save log, exit) · Info (module status, about)
- **File type selector** — CSV or TXT
- **Output folder picker** — modern dialog (WindowsAPICodePack) with classic fallback
- **Progress bar** — real-time progress with status text
- **Export buttons** — one button per export type, color-coded
- **Log panel** — timestamped real-time log with Clear and Save buttons

## 📋 Export Functions

### Export AD Users

Exports all domain user accounts to a single file.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SamAccountName | Logon name |
| Name | Full name |
| DisplayName | Display name |
| Mail | Email address |
| Enabled | Account status |
| WhenCreated | Creation date |
| Department | Department |
| Title | Job title |

### Export AD Groups

Exports all domain groups with properties. Optional **nested member** expansion via checkbox.

#### What are Nested Members?

Nested members are users (or computers) that belong to a group **indirectly** — through another group that is itself a member. Active Directory supports nesting groups inside groups, which means a single group can contain members that are several levels deep.

**Example:**

```
Group A
 ├─ User1          ← direct member
 ├─ Group B        ← nested group
 │    ├─ User2     ← nested member
 │    └─ User3     ← nested member
```

With **Include nested members** checked (`-Recursive`):
- Export resolves all levels: **User1, User2, User3**

Without it (unchecked):
- Export shows only direct members: **User1, Group B**

This is important in large AD environments where security groups are built by nesting other groups — without recursive resolution, the actual users who have access through those groups would not appear in the export.

**Groups only** (checkbox unchecked):

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Group name |
| SamAccountName | Group logon name |
| GroupCategory | Security / Distribution |
| GroupScope | Global / Universal / DomainLocal |
| Description | Group description |
| Mail | Group email |
| ManagedBy | Manager DN |
| WhenCreated | Creation date |
| WhenChanged | Last modified |

**Groups + Nested Members** (checkbox checked) — single file with all groups and their recursively resolved members:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GroupName | Parent group |
| MemberSamAccountName | Member logon name |
| MemberName | Member display name |
| ObjectClass | user / computer / group |

### Export AD Computers

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Computer name |
| SamAccountName | Computer account |
| DNSHostName | FQDN |
| OperatingSystem | OS name |
| OperatingSystemVersion | OS build |
| Enabled | Account status |
| LastLogonDate | Last logon timestamp |
| WhenCreated | Creation date |

### Export OU Tree

Generates an indented tree view of all Organizational Units, sorted by `CanonicalName` for correct parent→child ordering. Output is always `.txt`.

```
Root OU
  Sub OU A
    Sub Sub OU
  Sub OU B
```

### Export GPOs

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DisplayName | GPO name |
| Id | GPO GUID |
| Owner | Owner |
| CreationTime | Created |
| ModificationTime | Last modified |
| GpoStatus | Enabled / Disabled |
| UserVersion | User config version |
| ComputerVersion | Computer config version |
| WmiFilter | WMI filter name |

### Export FSMO Roles + Domain Info

Exports a `.txt` report containing FSMO role holders and Domain Controllers.

**Default output (checkbox unchecked):**
- Domain name and Forest name (summary line)
- FSMO role holders table (PDCEmulator, RIDMaster, InfrastructureMaster, SchemaMaster, DomainNamingMaster)
- Domain Controllers table (Name, IPv4Address, OperatingSystem)

**With "Include full Domain/Forest details" checked:**
- Full `Get-ADDomain` output (all properties)
- Full `Get-ADForest` output (all properties)
- FSMO role holders table
- Domain Controllers table

## 📝 Changelog

### v1.1 — June 2025

- **About window fix** — resolved `XmlNodeReader` consumed-reader crash on second open; XAML is now re-parsed on every click
- **Hyperlink fix** — About window link uses `RequestNavigate` event (correct WPF pattern) instead of `Click`
- **Version tracking** — added `$script:AppVersion` variable; displayed in About window title
- **Progress bar reset** — each export now resets to 0% before starting, preventing stale 100% display from previous operation
- **UI responsiveness** — added `DoEvents()` pump to `Set-ProgressState` to keep the window responsive during long exports
- **Robust nested member enumeration** — per-group `try/catch` with `-ErrorAction Stop` to handle orphaned SIDs, unresolved objects, and timeouts gracefully (logs warning per group instead of aborting entire export)
- **OU tree sort fix** — changed from alphabetical `DistinguishedName` sort to `CanonicalName` sort for correct parent→child ordering
- **Test-Path operator fix** — fixed operator precedence bug in DLL detection (`-and` inside `Test-Path` parameters)

- WPF Flat Single Window UI (light mode)
